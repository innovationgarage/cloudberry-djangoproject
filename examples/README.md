# Example backends

Backends.json contains an export of two backends that can be imported
using the Import functionality in the GUI:

## CloudberryVPN

Lets you configure a VPN server running inside a docker container, and
a set of clients running on e.g. RPi:s, each with a lan behind it,
routing traffic over OpenVPN via the docker container between the
lan:s.

## CloudberryVPNDockerManager

servers.
